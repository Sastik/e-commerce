          <h2>1. What is trade cycle?</h2>
          <p>
            A trade cycle is the series of exchanges that occur when a
            commercial exchange is executed between a customer and a supplier.
          </p>
          <h3>Types of Trade Cycle:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Economic Cycle:</b> The overall pattern of growth and
              contraction in an economy, typically lasting 5-10 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Business Cycle:</b> Fluctuations in business activity during
              different phases of the economic cycle, consisting of four stages:
              recovery, prosperity, recession, and depression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Financial Cycle:</b> Shifts in financial markets, such as stock
              prices, bond yields, or foreign exchange rates.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Phases of a Trade Cycle:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Depression:</b> Economic activity is very low. Income,
              production, employment, prices, and profits fall. Resources are
              idle, and pessimism prevails, leading to business closures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Recovery:</b> The economy starts to improve. Output,
              employment, income, and prices rise slowly. Demand and investment
              increase, and optimism returns, leading to further growth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Prosperity:</b> Economic conditions are strong. There is high
              income and employment, no idle resources, rising wages, prices,
              profits, and interest rates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Recession:</b> Businesses cut back on investment, employment,
              and production due to realized mistakes. This leads to falling
              income, expenditure, prices, and profits.
            </li>

              the product.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Returns can be complicated:</b> Some of the processes of return
              or refund are easier, but many sellers make it complicated for the
              buyer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Delay in delivery:</b> Sometimes buyers have to face an

          <h2>8. Write a short note on a) Mobile computing b) WAP</h2>
          <h3>a) Mobile Computing</h3>
          <p>
            Mobile computing is the way to transmit data, voice, and video via a
            computer or any other wireless-enabled device without being
            connected to a fixed physical link.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this technology, data transmission is done wirelessly with the
            help of wireless devices such as mobiles, laptops, etc.
          </p>
          <h4>Types of Mobile Computing:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Mobile infrastructure:</b> Includes the wireless networks,
              wireless protocols, and data formats.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mobile hardware:</b> Consists of mobile devices or device
              components that can be used to receive or access the service of
              mobility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mobile Software:</b> A program that runs on mobile hardware.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Advantages:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Portability:</b> Mobile devices are smaller and more portable
              than traditional computers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Affordability:</b> Over time, mobile devices have become less
              expensive and easier to obtain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Wireless communications:</b> You can communicate from any
              remote location without being physically present there.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Battery issue:</b> Short battery life, limited processing
              power, smaller screen size.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Data security:</b> Mobile computing raises significant data
              security vulnerabilities.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>b) WAP</h3>
          <p>
            The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a set of communication
            protocols and an application programming model based on the World
            Wide Web (WWW).
          </p>
          <p>
            The WAP model consists of 3 levels known as Client, Gateway, and
            Origin Server.
          </p>
          <h4>Working Process:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              When a user opens the browser in their mobile device and selects a
              website that they want to view, the mobile device sends the URL
              encoded request via a network to a WAP gateway using WAP protocol.
            </li>
            <li>
              The request sent via mobile to WAP gateway is called an encoding
              request.
            </li>
            <li>
              The sent encoding request is translated through WAP gateway and
              then forwarded in the form of a conventional HTTP URL request over
              the Internet.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Advantages:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>WAP can be used over multiple platforms.</li>
            <li>Higher controlling possibilities are offered.</li>
            <li>You can send and receive real-time data with WAP.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              WAP connection speed is slow and the number of connections is
              less.
            </li>
            <li>Less secure.</li>

          <h3>WAP:</h3>
          <p>
            The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a set of communication
            protocols and an application programming model based on the World
            Wide Web (WWW).
          </p>
          <p>
            The WAP model consists of 3 levels known as Client, Gateway, and
            Origin Server.
          </p>
          <h4>Working process:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              When a user opens the browser in his/her mobile device and selects
              a website that he/she wants to view, the mobile device sends the
              URL encoded request via a network to a WAP gateway using WAP
              protocol.
            </li>
            <li>
              The request he/she sends via mobile to WAP gateway is called an
              encoding request.
            </li>
            <li>
              The sent encoding request is translated through WAP gateway and
              then forwarded in the form of a conventional HTTP URL request over
              the Internet.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Advantages:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>WAP can be used over multiple platforms.</li>
            <li>Higher controlling possibilities are offered.</li>
            <li>You can send and receive real-time data with WAP.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              WAP connection speed is slow, and the number of connections is
              less.
            </li>
            <li>Less secure.</li>

          <h2>29. Justify why the following may be considered as hidden costs of ERP: Customization, Training, Integration & testing, Consultants</h2>
          <p>
            Hidden costs in ERP implementations can arise from several areas
            that aren't immediately obvious. Hereâ€™s why each of these aspects
            might be considered hidden costs:
          </p>
          <h3>Customization:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Software Modification: Customizing ERP software to fit specific
              business needs can incur additional expenses, requiring extensive
              coding and testing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintenance Overhead: Customizations add complexity, necessitating
              ongoing maintenance and updates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Vendor Lock-In: Heavy customizations can make switching vendors
              difficult and costly in the future.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Training:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Employee Time: Training diverts employees from regular duties,
              impacting productivity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Training Materials: Developing and updating manuals, tutorials,
              and other resources adds to costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Employee Turnover: Increased turnover raises training costs as new
              employees require onboarding.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Integration & Testing:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Data Migration: Moving data from old systems to the new ERP can be
              complex and costly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Testing Environments: Setting up test environments for integration
              and compatibility testing incurs expenses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quality Assurance: Extensive testing is crucial to identify and
              resolve integration issues, preventing disruptions.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Consultants:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Initial Implementation: Hiring external consultants for ERP
              implementation involves significant upfront costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ongoing Support: Continued reliance on consultants for maintenance
              and optimization leads to recurring expenses.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These hidden costs can significantly impact the overall budget and
            should be carefully considered during ERP implementation planning.
